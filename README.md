## Hi!

My name is MultisampledNight or multisn8 for short, but any variations are okay!
Most people just call me Multi, use any pronouns you like!

Things I'm usually working with include:

- Rust
- Python
- Godot
- Blender
- Inkscape
- Acoustic guitars

Areas which I also want to become better in are:

- ***Anything*** around games
- Designing large systems
- Naming things
- Communication (and its design, implications, all around)
- Abusing GPUs
- Animation and design in every shade

while I do understand to learn a new tool if required for the task at hand. I'm
usually curious, shy, easily distracted by anything that looks interesting, and
I'm also guaranteed to waste your entire afternoon by talking about the
awesomeness of Blender.

Feel free to hit me up about pretty much anything! If you happen to know me from
elsewhere, probably that platform is best for communication, else you could take
a look at recent commits to get my email~
